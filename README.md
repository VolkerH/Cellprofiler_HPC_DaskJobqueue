# Distributing Cellprofiler Jobs on a HPC Cluster using Dask Jobqueue

Author: Volker Hilsenstein , Monash Micro Imaging

This repository tries to demonstrate how to distribute Cellprofiler jobs on a high perfomance compute cluster
using Dask Jobqueue. I am demonstrating this on a SLURM cluster but due to the use of Dask Jobqueue this should be
transferrable to other HPC environments with minimal changes.
